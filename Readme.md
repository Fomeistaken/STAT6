    git clone https://github.com/Fomeistaken/STAT6

### 2-Rename `.env.template` to `.env`
### 3-To get the Discord Bot's token, go to [This Link](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new application.

### 4-Once created the bot, go to the bots section on in the sidebar and click build a bot, after that get the bot token and paste it in the `.env` file in place of `yourdiscordbottoken`

### 5- In the Discord Developer Portal in the sidebar go to OAuth2 then URL generator and invite the bot to your server with admininstrator permissions just for safety measure
### 3- Run the following commands
        npm install
        node index.js
`npm install` installs the required libraries and
`node index.js` start the project 

_PS: You need MEE6 with its ranking system in your server and your server leaderboard should be public or the code won't work_
